# Alpha + Demo  

   This is a code Demo built on PHP Laravel 5.7 Framework. (upgraded to Laravel Framework 6.20.3) 

   With the MVC Software Architecture: Using PHP code for the Controller functions, MySql as  the source of data (with PHP Modeling it) and the Blade Templates + jQuery & ChartJs Libraries for the View.

   First it retrieves the Real Info @ Real Time, of the exchange rate of EUR/USD, from a remote API (https://forex.1forge.com) using Ajax, then the received info in Json format is saved in the MySql Database, and then the Table and Charts are renewed too.

   To access the Dashboard just login like: 
      user: demo@gmail.com 
      password: 123456

   Enjoy it,

Alejandro D. Bakker Antezana
